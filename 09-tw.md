事件的移除
--------

`草稿` `可選項` `作者:scsibug`

類型 `5` 的事件表示在 tags 段落裡一至數筆標籤 `e` 紀錄，都是作者要求要「刪除」的事件。

每個標籤紀錄須包含 "e" 事件 id，代表要刪除的事件。

事件的 `content` 欄位可以帶對於這次刪除的說明。

例如：

```
{
  "kind": 5,
  "pubkey": 「以 32 位元組， 16 進制數字，表達事件發送者的公鑰」,
  "tags": [
    ["e", "dcd59..464a2"],
    ["e", "968c5..ad7a4"],
  ],
  "content": "這批事件為誤傳，故須刪除",
  ... 其他欄位
}
```

中繼站須刪除相關事件，或停止繼續轉送那些事件。藉由比對相同的事件 id 。客戶端須幫忙遮蔽刪除的事件，或明確指出那些相關事件的刪除狀態。

Relays SHOULD continue to publish/share the deletion events indefinitely, as clients may already have the event that's intended to be deleted. Additionally, clients SHOULD broadcast deletion events to other relays which don't have it.

## Client Usage

Clients MAY choose to fully hide any events that are referenced by valid deletion events.  This includes text notes, direct messages, or other yet-to-be defined event kinds.  Alternatively, they MAY show the event along with an icon or other indication that the author has "disowned" the event.  The `content` field MAY also be used to replace the deleted event's own content, although a user interface should clearly indicate that this is a deletion reason, not the original content.

A client MUST validate that each event `pubkey` referenced in the `e` tag of the deletion request is identical to the deletion request `pubkey`, before hiding or deleting any event.  Relays can not, in general, perform this validation and should not be treated as authoritative.

Clients display the deletion event itself in any way they choose, e.g., not at all, or with a prominent notice.

## Relay Usage

Relays MAY validate that a deletion event only references events that have the same `pubkey` as the deletion itself, however this is not required since relays may not have knowledge of all referenced events.

## Deleting a Deletion

Publishing a deletion event against a deletion has no effect.  Clients and relays are not obliged to support "undelete" functionality.
